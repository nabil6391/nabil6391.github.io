                        <p>I started my career as an <span className="highlight">Android developer</span>, responsible
                            for the complete development lifecycle of the mobile applications including designing user
                            interface, preparing content, programming and debugging.
                            I've been part of small and large (distributed) teams, I understood how crucial
                            documentation, version control, and effective team communication are in terms of having a
                            sane workflow.</p>

                        <p>Today I'm working as a <span className="highlight">front-end web developer</span> and
                            reaching a personal milestone, which is feeling confident in both sides of the spectrum to
                            develop Web Apps from back to front alogn with their mobile counterparts.</p>

                        <p>I'm working in this area using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript and <span
                            className="highlight">ReactJS</span> has become one of my favorite tools in web
                            development. React-Redux, Node.js, Django, Java, Android, AWS are the main tricks up my
                            sleeve.</p>

                        <p>In the near future, I'd like to take my JS and CSS3 skills to the next level
                            while learning more about UI/UX and <span
                                className="highlight">Progressive Web Apps(PWA)</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-emoji" style={{color: colorPrimary}}>
